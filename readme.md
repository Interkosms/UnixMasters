## .NET 7 and ML.NET

This is a reinterpreted sample project based on the [Microsoft sentiment analysis tutorial][docs].

It used .NET 7 to load yelp reviews from a text file, train a model, test its accuracy, and then allow you to pass in sentiment to predict a result.

This project uses Spectre.Console to create a repeating input prompt and result set.
